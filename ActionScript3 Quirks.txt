ActionScript3 features a loop "variable leak".
	Variables declared in a function are visible function-wide despite being declared in different loops.
	This means that this:
	
		for (var i:int = 0; condition, i++)
		{
			do thing;
		}
		for (i = 0; condition, i++)
		{
			do thing;
		}
		
	-would technically work, but this behavior can/will lead to hard to track down bugs, use sequential variable names instead. eg. 'i, j, k, l' etc.
