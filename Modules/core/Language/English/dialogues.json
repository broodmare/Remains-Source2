The thing is that she has a PipBuck. Guards who caught her sincerely believe that this is a scribe of the Steel Rangers. I won`t make them doubt their beliefs, but my experience says something completely different. The Steel Rangers would never have sent out a lone unarmed scribe. In this world, there are only three types of ponies that have access to such rarities as PipBuck: Steel Rangers, elite Red Eye guards and inhabitants of the still closed Stables. The latter are so rare that many believe there are no functioning Stables at all, but our captive clearly does not belong to the first two categories. Nooo, she`s from a Stable! If so, then, it seems, I am the luckiest bastard from here to Canterlot itself. This little chick looks like she`s just out of a test tube, and she certainly won`t last long in our world.

The ability to swear firmly and ornately is actually an important and essential part of intelligent speech, and there is absolutely nothing shameful in it if used properly. In most cases, simply adding a dirty word to your speech is not enough to impress audience and fully express your feelings, and many improve their skills of conveying emotions colorfully throughout entire life. Sadly, our dictionary will unlikely be enough to raise you to the level of real maestros of this art, because the truly masterful swearing should come intuitively and from your very heart. But thanks to this book, you can definitely get a starting point that will guide you in further improving your talents in this field\nThis book is divided into three main sections, depending on the dirtiness and strength of the curses. If you have never encountered rude expressions before, we strongly recommend that you start reading from the very first, most decent section. All the phrases listed here are universal and can be applied in any situation to express anger, resentment or admiration.\n1. Light swearing\nThis section gives examples of the most frequently used curses that are accepted in society as relatively civilized and acceptable for use even with foals. They will still allow you to clearly and vividly express your thoughts and your mood to the recipient.\nOh, Celestia curse you(them)!\nLuna`s curses!\nOh, for Celestia`s sake!\nDiscord`s spawn!\nOh Goddesses!\nLet you(them) choke on it!\nMay Luna smash your silly head!\nMay Celestia burn you(them)!\nMay Celestia and Luna bring curses upon you(them)!\nMay your friends abandon you!\nMay Discord take you!\nSweet Celestia!\nFlying feathers!\nMay goddesses damn you!\nHorseapples!\nPegasus horns!\nWhat the hay!"

                    "text": "2. Profanity.\nThis section contains samples of swearing considered taboo in society. In most cases, it contains abusive words designed to give a phrase more rigidity and edge. We recommend resorting to them only in the presence of ponies well-known to you who will not be offended by such an expression of emotions, and categorically do not recommend using them near foals, law enforcement officers and the Overmare/Overstallion.\nFuck!\nFuckity-fuck!\nFuck it with a horn!\nFor fuck`s sake!\nShut the fuck up!\nGo fuck yourself (themselves)!\nFuck your (their) asses with a hoof!\n(addressing a stallion) Bloody dragonfucker!\nParasprite`s dick!\nBloody bitch!\nSon of a bitch!\nBloody cunt!\n(addressing a filly) Bloody whore!\n(applicable to unicorn/stallions) Sit on my horn and spin!\nMotherfucking cocksucker!\nFucked up beyond all recognition!\nKiss my ass, you shitty little motherfucking cocksucking bastard!\nHoof me the fucking keys, you cocksucker, what the fuck?\n3. Blasphemy.\nThis part contains ugly and dirty curses, which to some extent involve the divine princesses Celestia and Luna. Many believe that mentioning them in such an ugly and rude way is a sin in itself, and our heavenly patrons may not tolerate such an attitude towards themselves. Therefore, use them only at your own risk.\nOh fuck me with Celestia`s forehooves!\nLuna rape you (them) with her horn!\nLuna fuck me with the moon.\nLuna shitting moon rocks!\nStick a horn where Celestia don`t shine!\nSolar-flaring orgasms of Celestia!\nLuna shove my cunt full of moonrocks and call me home.\nCelestia clop my clit with a hoof-full of sunfire!\nLuna`s tidal mareheat!\nCelestia suckle me!\nCelestia`s solar-flaring mareheat!\nLuna clop me with Her wings.\nOh Goddesses fuck me in a three-way\nCelestia`s solar-heated libido!\nLuna-eclipsing orgasms!\nHoly hot sex with Celestia!\nConclusion.\nIt does not matter what kind of curses you use and how they interact with each other. Remember that the most important thing about any swearing is its relevance. The ability to be aware of where and when you can, and where and when you shouldn`t swear will help you to maintain your culture and not be considered vulgar, at the same time creating an image of a harsh and tough pony. Therefore, it will be best if you, before starting to demonstrate the knowledge gained from your book, evaluate under what conditions your team members consider swearing appropriate and what type of curses are most common among them.\nGood luck in this difficult but noble art!\nBonus material.\nIn truth, when our team of authors worked on this book, we did not expect to add any additional material after the conclusion. However, the opus presented below is, without a doubt, simply obliged to appear on these pages in view of its unconditional uniqueness and exceptional relevance. This text was kindly provided by a representative of the library of our Stable, who wished to remain anonymous, and is a well-documented tirade of a senior official who lived many centuries before the War. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that, with its impressive length and incredible variety of words used, it was expressed by the author without any preparation and without purpose to get into history, but only in order to reprimand the royal guard who had fallen asleep at the post. Through the efforts of Princess Celestia`s adjutant, this impromptu was preserved and recorded in its original form, and now, despite the abundance of long-obsolete words, it is certainly an example of unsurpassed mastery in the art of dirty, but such colorful and amazing swearing (and the amazing power of the lungs).\nYou miserable bastard, bloody pants-pissing retard, motherfucking moron, buttfucked by a timberwolf, fart-smelling maggot, balllicking wanker, frigid son of a bitchy whore, zebra-humping insect-eating asshole, Discord`s scrotum sack, Tirek`s cocksucking excuse for a guard, cyka blyat, if I ever see you sorry ass asleep at the fucking post, then, for Celestia`s sake, I am gonna shove my hoof so far up your ass the water on my knee will quench your thirst before you can even fucking say \"horseshit\", do you fucking understand?!  \n|*The following sections contain examples of swearing so rude and indecent that even a seasoned raider could enrich his vocabulary with more than one new phrase*"

To be honest, I didn`t even understand what I saw: a terribly looking pony rushed straight at me, growling like wild animals. I barely managed to escape. Then I thought that it was just sick with some strange illness. However, a couple of days later I had an opportunity to examine these creatures closer. I was on the second floor of an old building, and there was a huge hole in the floor of one of its rooms. Through that I saw two of them below. I quietly crept to the edge and carefully studied their appearance. They were corpses, actual half-decayed corpses! They did not breathe, did not move at all, just stared blankly at the wall in front of them. Since then I tried avoiding meeting these creatures. Until I came across a camp full of quite alive and friendly ponies.\nThere, having become a little familiar, I began asking the inhabitants about the world around me. I learned a lot, but what`s really important, I found out that ghouls actually have some kind of life. Yes, they are not just puppets raised by magic, they are alive! It`s strange, very strange. How can an organism maintain life after such monstrous mutilation? Unfortunately, ponies in the camp couldn`t give me answers. I decided to put my questions about this into my to-do list"

I realized that to conduct a real experiment I need to work with subjects in a lab. It`s highly unlikely that ponies from the camp will be happy if I bring a smelly corpse with me and begin dissecting it. It seems that I will have to do experiments far from others.\nI picked the place quickly. The old underground sewers were pretty well populated with subjects for my research. In addition, it was easy hiding from them on elevated positions, and raiders don`t wander there - the biggest danger of all I met in the Wasteland. Really, I honestly have no clue why those ponies are so cruel.\nWell, the camp is doing well, and I hope that next week I will not be needed there. They are good ponies, they will be fine without me for a while. Just in case, I warned Calamiti that I am leaving for a week, so that if something happens to me, they would find me"

It is absolutely unfamiliar to me, and it is completely unlike any other pony magic I know. The body seems to be enveloped in the dark \"net\" centered in the head, and this network pumps up the dead limbs, awakening muscle memory and forcing them to move. Moreover, the \"center\" of this network nourishes the brain, and in some unnatural way it comes to life and begins controlling the body! Unfortunately, there is no higher cerebral activity, only animal instincts. Still, perhaps there are ghouls somewhere in whom the magic is so strong that it revives the mind completely?"

The target of the intruder was again the circulation of posters dedicated to the recent victory of our troops over zebras on the Grizley Islands. The whole circulation was taken, other valuables stored in the warehouse were untouched. That same night, guards found dozens of inscriptions \"Remember the massacre on the Grizzly Islands!\". Employees of my department had to get out of beds and clean up, but the rumor spread among the population was avoided. A corresponding conversation was held with the guards.\nThe main feature of this incident is that only ponies from our Ministry and the Ministry of Morale knew about the re-submission of the posters to the circulation, who deal with the problem of the Grizley Islands events.

It turns out her brother was one of the soldiers who died during the tragic events on the Grizzly Islands and whose death, along with deaths of many other ponies and information about the whole incident, we did not disclose to the public in order to preserve morale of the army and population. By these thefts and graffiti, she said, she tried to \"protect the honor\" of the deceased relative and \"distract herself from gloomy thoughts.\" At the moment she is being held in the investigation department of MoM\""

I worked a lot over it for the last few days and came to the conclusion that the ritual would be impossible without additional magical amplifiers. Unfortunately, my research did not give the slightest hint of what exactly could help us. I had to resort to additional techniques, of which I will tell you later, and today one of them has borne fruit.

I can tell you the details at the meeting, but the bottom line is that this can make a powerful weapon. Not just some kind of lame laser beams. My \"rays of kindness\", according to approximate calculations, will cut through power armor like paper.\nI already sketched the preliminary schematics, when suddenly these dumbheads woke up. I don`t know who told them that these crystals are not just some shiny trinkets. Now they are telling me that the crystals, like, are the intellectual property of their department under some bloody inventory number, which, by the way, must be returned.\nOf course, I sent them to the place where the sun doesn`t shine. Until I get a patent for my Friendship Cannon (working title, hehe), they are not getting anything from me. They threatened to use security guards, to take them by force. So, I hid the crystals. Stashed in different places all over the workshop.

The full text of the research work will be transmitted to you within three days from the date of sending this message, but I have to inform you that its results are far from being encouraging. According to the estimates of our research missions, the present level of pollution does not meet the requirements set by the project. Living conditions are unfavorable for life, a comfortable existence will require high expenditure for filtration equipment and isolation systems. Moreover, almost all flora and fauna adapted to life in such extreme conditions, including the once intelligent species of earth ponies and unicorns, who switched to a predatory lifestyle and pose a constant threat to future colonists. According to our calculations, costs of ensuring their safety go beyond reasonable, and reducing the level of environmental pollution seems to be completely impossible even if there was a possibility of using all the resources we have"

                    "text": "Gradually getting used to my first workplace. Junior laboratory assistant of the electrical equipment department. Already an achievement. Since childhood, I dreamed of being a scientist, studying and inventing things. So what that I haven`t work on new discoveries so far, but I have such a long way to go! I`m afraid to imagine what would happen if I, for example, became a junior PipBuck technician.\n\n***\nIt took me less than six months to thoroughly study the principle of operation of all electrical equipment present in our lab. From microscopes to toasters. Unfortunately, while my responsibilities include only preparing and equipment operation and maintenance, I can hardly get access to anything more. The head of the lab noticed my enthusiasm, but I cannot take additional responsibilities until one of the other employees retires. There are too few jobs in the Stable.\n\n***\nMentor is worried about my self-nomination as a second assistant librarian. So far, I have been succeeding with all my tasks, but he fears that I may begin to overwork and make mistakes. Perhaps I should listen to him, but so far I do not feel any tension or exhaustion.\n\n***\nI was so glad about my appointment as a senior lab assistant. After Rosie decided to resign to the vacant post of physics teacher, I was considered the most suitable candidate. However, in fact, I do not like the new responsibilities as much as I thought. Responsibility for controlling junior laboratory assistants led to conflict with Shad. Not that I once sympathized with this idler, but when his weak motivation becomes your problem, things change. In addition, a new obligation - filling out the accounting documentation - quickly begins seeming like a waste of time as soon as you start doing it yourself. However, this is the only way to grow to become a real researcher.\n\n***\nPerhaps the best part of the job as a senior laboratory assistant is the ability to directly participate in new experiments necessary for research. You can learn so much for yourself! Recently, we conducted laboratory tests of a magical energy device, which, theoretically, can replace the Alicorn Amulet in the \"Sun\" project. And let the experiment end in failure (as always), but at least the data that we obtained during the experiment will help to improve the experimental design. Professor Brownie invited me to help him a little in the calculations, I hope this task will take us a long time.\n\n***\nToday I returned to my position as a junior lab assistant. The manager, of course, was not happy to learn about my wish to abandon my current duties, but when it turned out that Rose was only glad to return to the department from \"these damned foals\", problems disappeared by themselves. Perhaps now I am not likely to get an appointment to a research position soon, but at least I got rid of these organizational problems. In general, this is even for the best. In addition, I will now have more time to help Professor Brownie.\n\n***\nToday, another Chosen was sent outside the Stable. This time it was Velvet. Too bad this pony always cheered us all up. But she herself volunteered for this mission, and perhaps in some ways I even understand her. The longer I live here, the less I see the point in our work. The basis of our research here is the \"Sun\" project, but we constantly fail, trying to work without the necessary components, and sending new ponies that would never come back to get them over and over again. It seems to me that in fact everypony here has long-lost hope. Even if they don`t show that.\n\n***\nThe funny incident almost ended in serious consequences. Shad managed to disable our main power generators with just one coffee mug. I have no idea how, but Stable lived on batteries for almost a week, until our technicians found a way to restore power supply. It is terrible to think what would happen if they didn`t manage to fix them. Poor fella was assigned to retrain the extended course of WS when working with electrical appliances, and guess who was appointed as his instructor. Like I have nowhere to put energy. Well, that`s fine, I will try to do so that from now on Shadow knows WS like the back of his hoof.\n\n***\nMentor announced preparations for sending a new Chosen to the surface. After just a few months! We are never informed of the details of what is happening to them, but usually the next Chosen is sent a few years after the previous one. Apparently, things went really wrong with Velvet. I wonder if she`s still alive?\nI have not yet decided, but maybe I should volunteer. This is really scary, because no pony has ever returned from this mission, and I have no idea where I will get and what will be waiting for me there. And also this erasing of memory. But still... I have long-lost the desire to work here and it is pointless to spend my life on things that have been going in circles for many generations before me. With time I only feel more and more awful, and less and less desire to do my job. Perhaps going to the surface is really a way out?"

Let it be filled only with good milestones.\nDay 0\nSealing the Stable Pi after receiving a signal about the start of UK class events. Full assembly of the assigned personnel, followed by shelter isolation. The following months were spent on arranging new living conditions and trying to get in contact with other centers.\n\nYear 3.\nAfter much debate, Equestria was declared to be permanently lost. It was decided to abandon plans for organizing rescue missions in favor of secrecy and the security of the Stable. It was also decided to begin work on finding ways to replace the missing components for the \"Sun\" project.\n\nYear 5.\nThe birth of the first foal underground, Sunny Shine, marked the final stabilization of Stable society and the transition to a new way of life. A necessary goal, because even according to the most optimistic forecasts, the surface will become safe no earlier than after 60 years.\n\nYear 12.\nThe detection of a signal from the surface caused fierce debate and almost led to the decision to depressurize Stable. However, timely data on the deceptiveness of this signal prevented a potential disaster.\n\nYear 13.\nSubsequent studies of information coming from the surface have confirmed the preservation of intelligent life. However, evidence was also obtained of its exceptional hostility, as well as the unsuitability of the existing ecosystem for the survival of ponies. This paradox has yet to be resolved in the future.\n\nYear 25.\nFirst death in Stable Pi. The death of Long Grass due to a magical energy anomaly became the Stable`s first loss. It also revealed the existing problem of control over the containment of the studied artifacts.\n\nYear 37.\nControversy between members of the Stable leadership led to conflict. A group of residents under the command of chief guard Fire Grind entered into a violent confrontation with the rest of the authorities in order to take control of Stable Pi. After the riot was successfully suppressed, a decision was made to reorganize the Stable management.\n\nYear 60.\nA constant contact was established with a representative of the surface calling himself the \"Watcher\". With his invaluable help in studying the surface, he earned the partial trust of the Stable residents, but he refuses to provide any information about himself.\n\nYear 66.\nA major malfunction in the air ventilation system almost became a reason for the Stable evacuation.\n\nYear 68.\nTwo years after the accident, the reasons for the ventilation system failure are clarified. An extremely huge and aggressive subspecies of domestic cockroaches penetrated the Stable. Their origin is not exactly known. The longest pest war in the history of Stable Pi begins.\n\nYear 73.\nThe destruction of the last Radroach nest in the Stable marks the final victory of the sanitary security forces over the chitin threat.\n\nYear 87, month 1.\nThe second case of armed conflict between the residents of Stable Pi. Internal contradictions lead to the division of the Stable inhabitants into two camps, none of which are able to assert their superiority. The territory of the Stable is actually divided into two different \"states\".\n\nYear 87, month 4.\nThe conflict is settled thanks to diplomacy and common sense. A new, at the moment, final management reform is being conducted to eliminate similar situations in the future.\n\nYear 95.\nThe death of the \"Watcher\" deprives Stable of the only reliable source of information about what is happening on the surface. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained is sufficient to make a decision on the complete rejection of contacts with its inhabitants and maintaining the secrecy status.\n\nYear 99.\nIt was decided to send ponies to the surface in order to obtain the missing elements of the \"Sun\" project. Praised Sun is declared the Chosen one and teleports up after the preliminary use of amnestics.\n\nYear 103.\nAfter much debate, it is decided to send the second Chosen to the surface. Subsequently, a new volunteer was regularly appointed to this mission, with interruptions of about four years.\n\nYear 127.\nMiss Charming Smile invents a new baking recipe that greatly diversifies the meager diet of Stable Pi residents, for which she is awarded with the title \"the Hero of Stable Pi\".\n\nYear 143.\nAfter years of research and preparations, Professor Rainy Night has made a breakthrough in trying to create an alternative to the Alicorn Amulet. Despite the fact that the knowledge gained does not make it possible to do without this artifact, they allowed reorganizing the Stable power system, significantly increasing the efficiency and safety of the power supply.\n\nYear 152.\nThe signal, mistaken for the Chosen-12 attempting to contact home, is recorded and studied in detail by the electrical equipment department. It was found that a certain group of ponies was trying to find Stables by forging a distress signal. Additional measures for Stable Pi`s security have been taken, a plan has been developed in case of detection by hostile organizations.\n\nYear 171.\nActive discussion of Stable`s failure to complete the \"Sun\" project leads to development of the research restructurization plan. Special departments are created to achieve results in the shortest possible time. Regretfully, after ten years work of these departments proved to be inefficient.\n\nYear 189.\nThe incident in the main generator room led to a serious power outage. A pony named Shadow Drop spilled coffee on the control panel, which as a result of a series of unlikely events led to acceleration of the generators above safe values ​​simultaneously with failure of automatic emergency cutoff systems. Power production was restored only a week after.\n\nYear 190.\nThe Omegatron-Y intergalactic robot has captured the planet and requires unconditional submission! The Stable Pi team sends the bravest, smartest and most beautiful pony - Gusty Trot - to fight the invader! When my dad sees this recording, he will be proud of me! I will protect Equestria, you`ll see!"
