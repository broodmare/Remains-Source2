    <n>Ponies, zebras and griffins</n>
    <info>Pony - a dominant species of sentient beings inhabiting Equestria. They`re divided into three races: unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies. Each race has its advantages and disadvantages. Unicorns have a gift of telekinesis, and with special training can master various magical spells, pegasi can fly, and earth ponies are the most strong, endurant and tenacious of all. Currently, you can meet many unicorns and earth ponies in the Wasteland. Pegasi on the other hoof are rarely encountered, as most of them live in their cloud cities and don`t descend to the ground.
Zebras - residents of a distant country, the main enemies of the ponies in the Great War. At present, their descendants quite often can be found in Equestria, and, despite the centuries past, the old enmity has not yet been forgotten. Zebras do not have magical powers like unicorns but can use witchcraft, curses, potions, and amulets, and some still remember the ancient art of necromancy.
Griffins are not so numerous in Equestria, and most of them serve as mercenaries. Physically they are stronger than ponies, and have the ability to fly, but do not own any magical powers</info>

Raiders often get into packs or even large gangs, ruled by the leaders.

    <n>Robots</n>
    <info>Robots are the product of technological revolution, one that Equestria experienced during the years before the Great War. They represent a combination of the most advanced earth pony technology and unicorn magic and were created for performing variable tasks - from housekeeping to property protection. During the War, combat models were also developed to be used in military operations.
Although no pony produces robots nowadays, many of them are still functional despite centuries past. Mostly, these are combat and security robots that continue to execute built-in programs and are ready to bring all their power down upon any intruder entering their domain</info>
  </unit>
  <unit id="turret" v="0.6">
    <n>Turrets</n>
    <info>Turrets are stationary robots designed to protect various objects. They have powerful weapons such as machine guns and magical energy weapons and they open fire on any violator stepping into their range. Typically, turrets are controlled by a common security system and can be disabled or reconfigured through the appropriate terminals</info>
  </unit>
  <unit id="turret0">
    <n>Ceiling turret</n>
    <info>These turrets are mounted on the ceiling. They are fairly compact, but poorly protected from damage, and can be destroyed by breaking the mounts. There are concealed versions that come out only in combat mode</info>
  </unit>
  <unit id="turret1">
    <n>Ground turret</n>

  <unit id="turret2">
    <n>Wall turret</n>
    <info>Wall turrets are attached directly to the wall or mounted on a special rail, along which they can move from one end to the other. Their barrel can turn 360 degrees</info>
  </unit>
  <unit id="turret3">
    <n>Armored turret</n>
    <info>This turret is mounted on a heavy, sturdy base and is protected by armored plates and a powerful force field effectively counteracting both mechanical and magical energy impact</info>

  <unit id="turret4" v="0.8">

  <unit id="robobrain">
    <n>Robobrain</n>
    <info>One of the first serial models of multifunctional robots, in which a central processor is replaced with a real living brain, placed in a glass tank. It has two hose-like manipulators designed to perform various actions, caterpillar tracks and weak armament, like electric discharger or laser. In general, this model has many disadvantages and is hardly suitable for combat. Robobrains are rather sluggish, clumsy, dull and do not pose much threat</info>
  </unit>
  <unit id="protect">
    <n>Ponytron</n>
    <info>A common model of a security robot that looks like a pony. It can perform such functions as defending its owners, protecting property and military objects, maintaining order and enforcing the law and so on. For this purpose, they have strong armor and medium-power weapons. Some sluggishness is partly compensated by the built-in levitation device, allowing the robot soaring in the air for some time and moving to higher grounds. Despite the fact that their owners died centuries ago, the ponytrones continue patrolling the entrusted objects and do not tolerate any intruders</info>

  <unit id="gutsy">
    <n>Mister Gutsy</n>
    <info>Military modification of the household robot "Mr. Handy", equipped with a whole arsenal of all kinds of weapons. There is a plasma gun for long range, a flamethrower for close one and a circular saw for direct contact with the enemy. For movement the robot uses levitation magic, allowing it to continuously soaring above the ground. During the War, these robots were actively used on the battlefields, and now there are not many of them left. Unfortunately, their electronic brains have long been bungled, and now they no longer distinguish friends from enemies</info>

    <n>Equidroid</n>
    <info>Equidroids, the gem of former Equestrian technology, were created shortly before the apocalypse. The first models were quite peaceful, but almost immediately there appeared combat modifications equipped with the latest weapons, energy barrier and even some spells. They did not participate in battles because of their exceptional complexity and high cost, but served rich and influential persons as guards and assistants, looking and behaving almost like living ponies. Now the surviving equidroids seem to have lost the last remnants of their electronic intelligence and pose a considerable danger</info>

    <n>Sprite-bot</n>
    <info>A small flying robot, developed by the Ministry of Morale. Sprite bots were used as mobile transmitters, constantly broadcasting patriotic radio channel, while at the same time engaged in secret surveillance of citizens. Today sprite bots can still be found in plenty in the Wastelands. They usually do not represent danger, except when they are controlled by security systems of old closed strategic objects. In this case, they can try attacking the interloper using low-power weapons</info>
